# Kubernetes Troubleshooting Exercises

Folders will have one or more manifests created by "a user."

The user had an idea about what they wanted,
but "obviously" it's not doing "what it's supposed to."

## Exercises

## Naming

Folders are named as
[common birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_by_common_name);
they have no particular ordering.
