# A Basic Nginx Webserver

I'm creating a basic.. basic.. Nginx deployment and service.
But I don't know how I'm supposed to access it?

When I get the service its just showing port 80,
but that doesn't look right, it's normally thirty-thousand-something..

When I just run Nginx on a host, I can access it on `localhost:80`,
but it's not there either.
