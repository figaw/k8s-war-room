# A Basic Nginx Webserver

I wanted to learn Kubernetes and instead of just copy-pasting,
I was writing off this example, but I can't even get this working.

When I apply the `deploy.yaml` and `svc.yaml` manifests,
I'd expect that I could afterwards access the service somewhere,
on the `30???`-port of the service, on localhost. But nothing's there?
